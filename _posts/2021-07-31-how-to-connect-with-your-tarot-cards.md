Whether you’re brand new to tarot card reading or you’ve just purchased a new set of tarot cards, you already know that tarot card reading is a spiritual experience above all else. You not only have to be skilled in the entire experience in order to do a good job, but you also have to become one, so to speak, with the cards themselves. Connecting with your tarot cards is important because it helps the reading itself run more smoothly and naturally, and below are nine tips that should help.

## How I connect with my tarot cards

Here are the 9 ways I recommend to those wanting to connect with their tarot cards

### 1. Meditate Visually with the Cards

Pick out a tarot card and spend some time meditating on it. Take a look at the characters in the card and the scene that’s playing out before your eyes. Try to learn as much as possible about the card and what the characters are doing. Picture yourself in the scene with them and think about what you would ask them or how you would interact with the other characters if you were there.

Try to sense anything that the characters might be trying to tell you, as well as feelings or sensations you get while holding the card. And if you have questions for the characters, try and get a sense of what their answer might be. Try to get as much out of the experience as possible before you move onto the next card.

### 2. Ask Questions of the Cards

When a card is in front of you, use what is called the Interview Spread and ask questions of it as if you were interviewing it for a job. Typical questions could include what do you consider your strengths and your limitations? What can you teach me? What are the things I can learn from you? What is the potential outcome if I continue to work with you? Why should I consider you an asset to the reading?

You can usually come up with a lot of questions once you get the card in front of you. Just as in a real job interview, ask the card various questions, then listen quietly for the answer.

### 3. Sort and Reorder the Cards (If it’s an Older Deck)

If you have an older deck of cards that you haven’t used in awhile, you can get familiar with them again by sorting and reordering them. Go over each card and touch them lightly, or you can “knock” each card to awaken them. You can also start by sorting the cards from major arcana to minor arcana, then shuffle the cards well so they are ready for a reading.

Take your time doing this and try to get a feel for each card before shuffling them. The point is to connect with them again and be familiar with them so that you can use them successfully for your next tarot card reading.

### 4. Consider Keeping a Tarot Card Journal

This can sound more complicated than it is, and you don’t even have to use a fancy or expensive journal to do it. Just use a spiral notebook if you like! In it, devote a section to each card and list things such as:

* The date
* The card
* The deck that the card came from
* Insights, feelings, etc.
* Meaning and Interpretation
* Notes

If you do this with one card per day, it’ll give you time to really bond with each card and get to know it better. The advantage of a journal is that you can go back to that card at any time and see what you wrote down about it.
Once you do this for all 78 cards, you’ll automatically feel a connection to each and every one of them. And if you like, you can go on Instagram and Pinterest to get some ideas of how you want your journal to look when you’re done.

### 5. Examine Each Card in the Deck

For this task, one of the things you’ll be looking for is any card that is missing or damaged. If you pull out a deck you haven’t used in awhile, this could definitely be a problem. In addition, you’ll want to observe the following things:

* Are the court cards renamed?
* Are there recurring characters in the cards?
* Are there ones you particularly love? Ones you hate?
* Are there repeating symbols?
* Do the suits have a particular color theme?
* Have the suits been renamed?
* Do the suits follow elemental dignities such as coins as earth, cups as water, etc.?
* Does the design add new meanings to the cards? If so, these new meanings can influence the way you interpret them.

When you examine your tarot deck card by card, you’ll notice a lot of things about them that you’ll consider important when you go to do your next reading, but this can only happen if you’re as familiar with each of the cards as possible. You don’t have to memorize every detail of each card, but try to be as familiar with them as you can before you start reading.

### 6. Sleep with a Tarot Card Nearby

For this suggestion, you can either place the entire deck of cards under your pillow or on your nightstand, or just pull one card and put it there. If you pull just one card, either make it a card that you’d like to understand better or one you believe will influence the following day. Many times, the assistance you need with a certain card will come through to you in a dream.

Even if that doesn’t happen, sleeping with a tarot card close to you is a good way to develop a real connection with the card. This can only help you become a better tarot card reader in the end.

### 7. Rely on Your Little White Book for the Assistance You Need

The little white book, or LWB, is the manual or set of instructions that comes with the deck of cards. Mass-produced tarot cards can have LWBs with conflicting information, but if you choose an independent (indie) deck of cards, it is another story altogether.
While you shouldn’t rely on your LWB for everything, the truth is that you’ll have to consult it every now and then to make things easier on yourself. Hearing from the designers and developers of the deck is a great way to get to know the cards better, so there are a lot of advantages to keeping your LWB around for as long as you own the cards.

### 8. Cleanse Your Deck of Cards

There are numerous ways that you can cleanse your cards. You can place a crystal on top of the deck (for best results, try a clear quartz, selenite, or amethyst); wrap the deck in plastic wrap then place it in a bowl of salt; give it a sun bath by placing it in the direct sun for a while; or even smudge the deck with sage or some other type of incense.
If you like, you can do a little research into the various cleansing methods and determine which one feels right to you. They all work, but you have to learn the DOs and DON’Ts of each method to choose one that will work best for your particular tarot deck.

### 9. Start Using the Cards!

You can spend a lot of time preparing to use your tarot cards, but until you go ahead and start using them, none of this preparation will do you any good. You don’t have to spend weeks or months on getting to know your cards to start using them.

Using them the first time is likely to make you a little nervous, but the only way to learn is to go ahead and get started with your readings. Practice revealing one card daily for answers and for inspiration, then start using the cards on family and friends.

The more you practice, the better you’ll feel about offering readings for clients. You have to start somewhere, and the sooner you start reading your cards for yourself and for others, the sooner you’ll feel confident about the entire process.

## Conclusion

Connecting with your cards is crucial because it helps you develop a better sense of oneness not only with the cards themselves but also with the entire process. There are numerous ways to connect with your tarot cards, and even if you’ve never read before, there’s no need to worry. The truth is that anyone can develop and improve their intuition and become a better reader if they want to, and it all starts with developing a relationship with the cards so that you can know what they are capable of doing.

Tarot card decks are very powerful and help a lot of people lead better lives. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced tarot card reader, you can learn to do an even better job of reading for people if you feel a deep connection to your cards. The methods of doing this are simple and not at all time-consuming, so if you’re ready to start being the best tarot card reader on the block, start utilizing these methods and you’ll be ready to start reading before you know it.
