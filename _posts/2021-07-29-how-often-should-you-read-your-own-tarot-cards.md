Beginning tarot card readers always have questions, and one of the most common questions they have is, is it acceptable for a tarot card reader to read their own tarot cards? 

Fortunately, and maybe surprisingly to some people, the answer is a resounding "yes." Not only is it all right for you to read your own tarot cards, but it is actually a good way to develop your connection with the cards as well as your intuition. In other words, just like reading for someone else, reading your own tarot cards is a great way to learn about this skill, explore your talents, and become better at reading tarot cards for everyone else in the future.

## How Often Should You Read Your Own Tarot Cards?

**Common timeframes for reading your own tarot are daily, weekly or monthly. The time period selected will depend on the question you want answering, or the spread you are choosing.** 

No matter how many people you ask, the truth is that there will be lots of answers to this question. Just like getting a reading done for yourself when you’re not a reader, some people recommend reading your own tarot cards once a month, while others recommend doing it weekly, quarterly, or every three to six months. In fact, the frequency you utilize to read your own tarot cards can be less or more frequent than you would recommend for a regular customer or client. 

Some readers like to pull a card daily for themselves, but this is different from reading the deck for an official “reading.” Pulling one card per day is never a bad idea because it gives you some direction for the day. 

That being said, reading your own tarot cards regularly – for example, weekly or monthly – is better than doing so every three to six months or less often, simply because the more you read your own cards, the more comfortable you’ll get with the process and the better you’ll get at it, meaning it will help you on both a personal and a professional level.

## Reasons Why You Should Read Your Own Tarot Cards

Before we get to how often you should read your own tarot cards, let’s discuss some of the reasons why doing so is more than just okay – it is an awesome experience. These reasons include:
 *  You learn to trust yourself. You might be a little nervous the first few times you read for yourself, but you’ll learn to trust your intuition and your inner wisdom the more you do so.
*  Your intuition will greatly improve. Anyone can improve their intuition ability, and reading tarot cards for yourself is a great way to do this.
*  You’ll learn more about tarot itself. Regardless of how long you’re a tarot card reader, you can still learn more about the activity, this being another advantage of reading tarot for yourself.
* You can learn to create a space to “tune in” to everything going on around you. This is a sacred space indeed, and it is a space you’ll learn more about every time you read for yourself.
Reading tarot for yourself improves all of the skills you’ll need to read for other people. After all, we’re all in this together, and getting experience in tarot card reading is invaluable whether you’re reading for other people or even for yourself.

## Mistakes Some People Make – and How to Avoid Them

Before you start a reading for yourself, you should spend some time meditating, focusing, and concentrating on your intuition and the wisdom you’ll need to conduct the reading properly. 

Sometimes, people make mistakes when reading their own tarot cards. When this happens, don’t panic. It happens to everyone. But if you’re aware of potential mistakes beforehand, it can lessen the likelihood of making the mistakes in the first place. Below are some common mistakes tarot card readers make when reading for themselves and what to do about them.

* Doing multiple readings on the same topic. You’ve been wondering if your boyfriend is ever going to propose to you, and you seek the answer from your tarot cards. Let’s say you get an answer you’re not happy with – now what do you do? The first thing you should do is treat yourself just like you would a client, and one of those rules is to never do multiple readings on the same topic. You wouldn’t do this for a client, and you shouldn’t do it for yourself, either.
*  You lose your objectivity. When it comes to reading tarot cards, there is often a fine line between ego and objectivity. Sometimes, we see and hear what we want to see and hear and not the truth. Before you start your reading, make sure you create that sacred space first so that you can go into the process with an open heart and an open mind. When reading for yourself, you can’t afford not to be objective because it is one of your greatest attributes for doing this.
*  You keep searching until you find what you were hoping to find. For example, you may pull the Five of Pentacles because you want answers on a certain matter. When you finally get to the tenth book, you see a sentence in small print that tells you what you want to hear. This is not exactly how reading your own tarot cards is supposed to go. Be honest with the process and do it objectively and in a straightforward manner – again, just like you would for a real client.
The gist of this information is that if you’re going to read your own tarot cards, whether monthly or weekly, you have to treat yourself like you would a client. This means being objective, honest, and willing to not cut corners to get the results – regardless of what those results say.

## Conclusion

Reading your own tarot cards is part art, part science, and the more you do it, the better you’ll get at it. Being objective and making sure you listen and see what the cards actually tell you, instead of hearing and seeing just what you want to, is a must if you want those readings to be efficient. You can read weekly or monthly, but just remember that the more you do the readings, the better you’ll get at them.
